## Hardware

### Version 0.1.x

First version of MateLight. We build it with our kids and teens in our youth group of the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) in Göttingen. Our focus was to learn professional soldering methods, a general hardware skills and to program something really cool in Python.

- [MateLightCrateConnector](https://github.com/HansAchterbahn/MateLightCrateConnector)

### Version 0.2.x

Version two of MateLight improves it with a better power supply concept. In the first version, we had a drop of 1 - 2 volts from input and output to the center of a crate.

## Software

### MateLight Driver and Simulator

This repo contains the driver for the MateLight Project. It can handle different buildups and allows all important basic functions like init matelight, get and set pixel and so on.

Also, a MateLight simulator is included. This comes handy if you are creating light effects without sitting in front of an actual huge MateLight (which you can't transport with your laptop in a small pocket ^_^`).

### Common Light Effect Collection

This collection was created for the first installation of the MateLight at the 36. Chaos Communication Congress (36c3) in Leipzig in 2019. Since then, all effects of all installations are collected in this repo.

### RC3 Light Effect Collection for the Remote Chaos Experience (rc3) 2020 and 2021

This collection was created for the second and third installation of the MateLight Project at the rc3 in 2020 and 2021. We had a interactive website with a video installation where visitors were able to interact with the MateLight remote. The MateLight until had a place in the showcase of the 'boats people' theater in Göttingen.
